# contact-list
Our QuickStart goal is to build and run a super-simple Angular 2 application in TypeScript.

We need to set up our development environment:

1. install git, node and npm.
2. Clone the contact-list repository.
git clone https://github.com/shobhit-m/contact-list.git
3. install node packages
npm install

We're all set.

Compile and run!
Open a terminal window and enter this command:
npm start
